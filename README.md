# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

This application will generate a random password of lengths between 8 and 128 characters, based on user input. Upon pressing the "Generate Password" button, the user will be prompted for a password length. Then a series of yes or no popups will appear to determine which characters to use in the password.
